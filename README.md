The app stores sample movie from the youtube channel "MosFilm" in a MongoDB Database and allows users to enter, update, or delete their data. The user, once authenticated, is allowed to get the movie data and add or remove movies to a list of their favorites.

The project is available on Github (https://github.com/Will-Maple/movie_api) and may be deployed here (https://mosfilm-api.onrender.com/). The deployment link contains further documentation.
