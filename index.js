        Description: "'The Mirror' movie represents reflections, thoughts of the person named here as the Author. He does not appear personally, only his tired voice sounds. And on the screen, as if in a mirror, are pictures of his past. At first, the memories seem scattered: love for the mother, which the Author does not know how to express, a piercing feeling for the father, dissatisfaction with himself for the undeveloped relationship with his son ... Gradually it becomes clear - this is a personâ€™s account of himself, a difficult judgment of conscience, maybe even a sentence. The film occupies a special place in the work of Andrei Tarkovsky. In it, he captured his aged mother Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova-Tarkovsky, behind the scenes the voice of his father, the poet Arseny Tarkovsky, reciting his wonderful poems sounds. It's a confession film, a revelation film...",

His creations showed the world a miracle of harmony, beauty, light, hope - and all this at a time when the country is torn apart by princely civil strife, and Tatar raids, famine and pestilence are chasing the people. The film is divided into eight short stories, which have little plot connection with each other, but paint a general picture of medieval Russia, which is taking shape like a mosaic work. The film was included in the 100 best films in the history of cinema, according to a survey of film critics of the world in 1978.",
